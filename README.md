Hi! I am Shashank Kirtania, final year computer engineering major student. Passionate about NLProc, Speech Processing, Computer Vision, statistics. `[more vaguely applied machine learning]`
You can always drop an email if you want to collaborate on any project in domains of { Applied Machine Learning, Blockchain, Computer Networks or Linux Kernel Development}.

I recently completed my internship at [Wadhwani Ai](https://www.wadhwaniai.org) where I worked on speech verification and text complexity. Apart from this I worked as research intern at [HiPeRt labs](https://hipert.unimore.it).
