What I do, what I like, what consumes most of my time etc.

### Student
I am a final year student at Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology with a major in Computer Engineering and a minor in cyber security. I am also a research intern at IIT Delhi, working with Dr VVK Srinivas. I am also working as an open-source contributor at PyMC.

### Other Interests
I was lucky enough to travel a lot of places in India (mostly) and got to click a lot of random things around me. A collection of them is present at my vsco

Apart from this, I pursued football in high school in my first year of college and I love to follow Champions League.
