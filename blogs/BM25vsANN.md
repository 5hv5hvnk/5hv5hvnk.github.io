### BM25 and ANN-based search

When it comes to information retrieval, there are a few different approaches that can be taken to rank documents based on their relevance to a given query. Two popular methods are BM25 and ANN-based search.

#### BM25

BM25 (Best Matching 25) is a ranking function that takes into account several factors to determine the relevance of a document to a query. These factors include the frequency of the query terms in the document, the length of the document, and the length of the query. BM25 also incorporates a measure of document specificity, known as the inverse document frequency (IDF), which penalizes terms that appear in many documents and rewards terms that are rare.
```
score(d, Q) = ∑(i=1 to n) IDF(qi) * ((f(qi,d) * (k1 + 1)) / (f(qi,d) + k1 * (1 - b + b * (|d| / avgdl))))
```
where:
- d is the document being scored
- Q is the query being used
- qi is the i-th query term
- n is the total number of query terms
- f(qi,d) is the frequency of the i-th query term in the document
- IDF(qi) is the inverse document frequency of the i-th query term
- k1 and b are tuning parameters
- |d| is the length of the document in words
- avgdl is the average document length in words

#### ANN-based Search
ANN-based search (Approximate Nearest Neighbor search) is a technique that involves using algorithms to efficiently find the nearest neighbors to a given query point in a high-dimensional space. This technique is often used in machine learning and data analysis applications.

ANN-based search can be used in information retrieval systems to quickly find the most relevant documents to a given query. By using ANN algorithms to efficiently search through a large corpus of documents, it is possible to greatly reduce the time and computational resources required for information retrieval.

Conclusion <br>
Both BM25 and ANN-based search are popular techniques for information retrieval. BM25 is a ranking function that takes into account several factors to determine document relevance, while ANN-based search is a technique for efficiently finding the nearest neighbors to a given query point. By using these techniques in combination, it is possible to build highly effective information retrieval systems that can quickly and accurately find relevant documents.
