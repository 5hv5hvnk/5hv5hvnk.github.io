Hi! I am Shashank Kirtania, pre-doctoral research fellow at Microsoft [PROSE team](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/prose/). I work with [Gustavo Soares](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/gsoares/), [Arjun Radhakrishna](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/arradha/) and [Sumit Gulwani](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/sumitg/). My current research is about improving understanding code and reasoning from it using language models. <br>
Previously I have been privelged to work with Soma Dhavala and Makarand Tapaswi during my time at Wadhwani AI developing speech related solutions for indic languages which was deployed in Gujarat and have completed over 10,00,000 successful assessment by Dec-2023. <br> <br>
I have also worked closely with Thomas Wiecki at PyMC labs where I spent most of my time improving workflow of bayesian models employeed by PyMC.
<br>
I am interested in how ML can help in synthesis, verification and repair of code (ML4PL) and how synthesis and verification can help in better explainability, generalizability  of algorithms (PL4ML). <br> I will be applying for PhD in Fall'25 cycle.
