Hi! I am Shashank Kirtania, final year computer engineering major student. Passionate about Computer Vision, NLP, ML-DL stuff, statistics. `[more vaguely applied machine learnig]`
You can always drop an email if you want to collaborate on any project in any domain related to { Applied Machine Learning, Blockchain, Computer Networks or Linux}.

I recently completed my capstone under Dr Shalini Batra (Head of Department of Computer Science Thapar Institue of Engineering and Technology) [here](https://github.com/5hv5hvnk/NoTouch/blob/main/Final%20Report%20NoTouch.pdf) is a detailed report of the effort.

Currently I am working with [Wadhwani Ai](https://www.wadhwaniai.org) as a ML intern. Apart from this I am working as a part time researcher at [HiPeRt labs](https://hipert.unimore.it).
