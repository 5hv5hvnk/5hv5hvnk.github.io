Hi! I am Shashank Kirtania, final year computer engineering major student. Passionate about NLProc, Speech Processing, and statistics. `[more vaguely applied machine learning]`
You can always drop an email if you want to collaborate on any project in domains of { Applied Machine Learning, Blockchain, Computer Networks or Linux Kernel Development}.

I recently completed my internship at [Wadhwani Ai](https://www.wadhwaniai.org) where I worked on speech verification and text complexity.

I have recently joined [Microsoft Research's PROSE](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/prose/) team as a Research Fellow.
