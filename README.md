Hi! I am Shashank Kirtania (he/him), pre-doctoral research fellow at Microsoft [PROSE team](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/prose/). I work with [Gustavo Soares](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/gsoares/), [Arjun Radhakrishna](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/arradha/) and [Sumit Gulwani](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/sumitg/). My current research focuses on enhancing the capabilities of language models (LMs) to understand, generate, and evaluate code. This involves discreet text optimization of prompts through techniques such as automatic prompt optimization, prompt synthesis, and external knowledge integration. Lately, I have been focusing on improving the code generation capabilities of SLMs using constrained decoding. <br><br>
`I am applying for PhD positions in the in the Fall'25 cycle.` <br><br>
Previously I have been privelged to work with [Soma Dhavala](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Rkh1zb8AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Makarand Tapaswi](https://makarandtapaswi.github.io/) during my time at [Wadhwani AI](https://www.wadhwaniai.org) developing AI4Education solution for Indic Languages which was deployed in Indian state of Gujarat and have completed over **1,000,000 successful assessments in first 6 months of deployment.**<br><br>
I have also worked closely with [Thomas Wiecki](https://twiecki.io/) at [PyMC Labs](https://www.pymc-labs.com/), where I spent most of my time improving the workflow of Bayesian models present in PyMC.
