Hi! I am Shashank Kirtania, pre-doctoral fellow at Microsoft [PROSE team](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/prose/). I work with [Gustavo Soares](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/gsoares/), [Arjun Radhakrishna](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/arradha/) and [Sumit Gulwani](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/sumitg/). My current research is about how to leverage language models to reason about code in order to attain complex software engineering tasks. <br>
Previously I have been privelged to work with Soma Dhavala and Makarand Tapaswi during my time at Wadhwani AI developing speech related solutions for indic languages which was deployed in Gujarat and have completed over 10,00,000 successful assessment by Dec-2023. <br>
I have also worked closely with Thomas Wiecki at PyMC labs where I spent most of my time improving workflow of bayesian models employeed by PyMC.
