What I do, what I like, what consumes most of my time etc.

### What I do?
I have recenlty started working with Speech Lab at IITM with Dr. S. Umesh and Dr. Hema Murthy on speech technologies for indic languages. Prior to this I worked at Wadhwani AI as ML intern with Dr. Makarand Tapaswi and Jatin Aggarwal.

### What I like?
I like to travell & explore places. I sometimes capture things in photos and you can find them on my [VSCO](https://vsco.co/5hv5hvnk/gallery). I like to play chess I suck at it but I still like to play it. I also like to watch a lot of non-fiction movies and shows and I am always open for suggestions :)

Apart from this, I love to play football and go on small cycling tours :')
