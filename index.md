What I like, what consumes most of my time etc.

### What I like?
I like to travell & explore places. I sometimes capture things in photos and you can find them on my [VSCO](https://vsco.co/5hv5hvnk/gallery). I like to play chess. I also like to re-watch movies and showsthat I have watched at some point of life :)

Apart from this, I love to play football and go on small cycling tours.

What consumes most of my time?
I spend time watching tech reviews, reading about devlopment in ML/PL research. I also have started a new hobby of reading to increase my off screen time.
